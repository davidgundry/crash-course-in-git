# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I tell git not to add certain files?

Create a `.gitignore` file (typically) in the root of the repository. Each line of this file lists a [pattern](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) of files to exclude. 

## How do I delete a git repository?

A git repository is a folder on your computer that contains a `.git` directory. If you delete the `.git` folder and all its contents the folder will revert to just being a plain folder.
